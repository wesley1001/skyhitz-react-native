# skyhitz-react-native-ios
Skyhitz Music React Native App for iOS

# Run App
1. Clone the repo
2. `cd skyhitz-react-native`
3. Open skyhitzapp.xcworkspace
4. Make sure you have installed cocoa pods and latest version of io.js or node

(node modules are being tracked so no need to npm install, this because there are some modifications on some of the modules)

# Why Are We Doing This?

- We want to transform the music industry and let artists get paid for their work.
- We want to create a system in which we let the public be the A&R's of music and be rewarded for finding the best music before others do. The earlier you support hit songs the more reputation you get. (Not at all like the bureaucracy of record labels)
- We want artists be the owners of their music. (Be supported by fans so they don't have to give away their music copyrights to monopolized corporations)
- Let the game be more fair for everyone.
